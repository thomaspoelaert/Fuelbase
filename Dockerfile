# Debian-slim base (not Alpine) — the @duckdb/node-bindings-linux-* native
# libraries used by the OFF mirror feature are glibc-linked and won't load
# on musl-based images. On Alpine, DuckDB fails with "Error loading shared
# library ld-linux-*.so.2: No such file or directory" because the glibc
# dynamic linker isn't present. DuckDB does not ship a musl variant of
# those node bindings, so a glibc base is required.
#
# Multi-arch note: this image builds for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
# (Raspberry Pi 4 / 5). npm picks the right @duckdb/node-bindings-linux-<arch>
# automatically during install based on the build platform.
